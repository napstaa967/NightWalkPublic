files you must modify:

LoadLevel.hx: add your custom level state
-copy TemplateLevelState.hx and rename the class and the file to "Level<name>State.hx"
-add Level<name>State.hx to the switch where case "<number>" should be your level name, it can be a string so you can have something like Level 1A

more advanced shit requires you to modify Player.hx
